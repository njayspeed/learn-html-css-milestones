  <h1>Anatomy of HTML Tag</h1>
  <p> Welcome to the Anatomy of an HTML page. This page will serve
  to help you learn the basic anatomy of an HTML tag. This page will talk about
  the following snippet:</p>

  <img src="../assets/img/snippet.png" alt="Picute of Basic Snippet">

  <p>
    <strong>Here is the actual code:</strong><br>
    Want to search the web?
    Try <a href="https://google.com" id="the-best-link" class="banana"  target="_blank">Google</a>!
  </p>

  <h2>Snippet Anatomy</h2>
  <p>The snippet has 2 tags:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Paragraph Tag <em>&ltp></em>
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp" target="_blank"> HTML Paragraph Reference</a>
    </li>
    <li>Anchor Tag <em>&lta></em>
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" target="_blank"> HTML Anchor Reference</a>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>There are a few other things to note about the snippet. In that code snippet
  the anchor tag (<em>&lta></em>) is a child of the the paragraph tag (<em>&ltp></em>).</p>

  <h3>Tag Anatomy</h3>
  <p>Tags are elements and have most contain opening and closing tags. The
  difference between <em>&ltp></em> and <em>&lt/p></em> is that the former is an
  opening tag and the latter is a closing tag. Also tags can have attributes which
  are extra bits of information. The anchor tag <em>&lta></em> in the snippet has
  the following attributes: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Href Attribute: The purpose of this attrubute is to specify the link's
      destination. When clicked it will take you to that destination. The value
      for the attribute in the snippet is <em>"https://google.com"</em>. When clicked
      it will take you to that site.
    </li>
    <li>ID Attribute: The purpose of this attribute is specify a unique ID for
      an HMTL element. The ID attribute is most used to point to a style in a CSS
      stylesheet. The value for the attribute in this snippet is <em>"the-best-link"</em>.
      There is no stylesheet so nothing will happen.
    </li>
    <li>Class Attribute: The purpose of this attribute is to specify one or more
      class names for an element. It is used similar to the ID attribute in that it
      is most used to point to a class in the CSS stylesheet. The value for the attribute
      in this snippet is <em>"banana"</em>. There is no stylesheet so nothing will happen.
    </li>
    <li>Target Attribute: The purpose of this attribute is to specify a name or
      a keyword that indicates where to display the response that is received after
      submitting the form. In this case since the value of the attribute is
      <em>"_blank"</em>, the page will open in a new tab or window.
    </li>
  </ol>
